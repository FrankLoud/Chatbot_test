# A quick but complete test of Seq2seq Chatbot

In the repository, I'll look into the performance of some famous deep learning methods for NLP tesk. 
Thus, I adopt the quickest implement of Seq2seq Chatbot by Tensorflow's new rnn API and show the excellent result. 
Hope you and me will get some insight into Seq2seq after completing the notebook.

For more instruction and demonstration of Basic Seq2seq, please read the chatbot_test.ipynb.

```
Q: do you have a free moment ?
A: sure . what do you need ?

Q: who is he marring ?
A: a girl he met on holiday in spain , i think .
G: he ' s a very good guy .
